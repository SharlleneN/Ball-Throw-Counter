# Ball-Throw-Counter

First personal project that was done for a friend with a startup. 
The concept of the product was to throw a ball attached to a lacrosse stick by a cord into the net, and if it landed inside, then the counter was to increment by 1 and display that on the screen. Overall an amazing concept as added weight to the stick would be a form of fun excercise that increases coordination and muscle growth for people with physical limitations.
The code attached was written by myself to count the number of times a ball falls through the net of a lacrosse stick. The components I used were an ir sensor, an oled screen, batteries, and an Arduino Nano. I also played around with various different types of sensors and microcontrollers, learned a lot with this project!
